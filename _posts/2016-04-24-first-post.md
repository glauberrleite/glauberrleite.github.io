Today I added a new functionality to this website, a blog. The blogging feature was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a good tool for blogware static sites that was recommended by Github itself for my 
page.  
In this section I'll bring news about my projects, works and so on, besides curiosities and ideas for the development world, things that may help some people in their own projects.


Let's see what the future will bring!

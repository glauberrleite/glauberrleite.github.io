                    <h3>Getting it straight</h3>

                    <p>I'm a Computer Engineering undergraduation student at
                    Universidade Federal de Alagoas - Brazil. And these are my
                    <em>current</em> main development interests:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Physics (almost every branches)</li>
                        <li>Academic Projects</li>
                        <li>Music software</li>
                        <li>Hardware focused programming</li>
                        <li>Free and Open Source Software</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Programming languages that I work the most:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>C++</li>
                        <li>C (only in projects where it's better than C++)</li>
                        <li>Verilog</li>
                        <li>Javascript
                        (I'm learning it, so I'm using it very much)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Technologies that I'm using:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/jfx-overview.htm">JavaFX<a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.qt.io/developers/">Qt/C++</a></li>

                    <h3>For the curious</h3>

                    <p>I made this page focused in development and technologies, 
                    so I'll not describe a complete (which means life phylosophy,
                    personal opinions, politics, arts) bio about me here. For a 
                    more personal approach I'm currently building my general-propose
                    website, which I'll make it available here.</p>

                    <h3>Heterogeneous workplace</h3>
                    
                    <p>First month in my new work. Beginning to learn how things 
                    are done and how the technological structure is making the 
                    University alive. So, I built a question in my thoughts: 
                    "How can I make something new in a well-established place?". 
                    Then I noticed that the establishment relies intensely of 
                    Microsoft Windows softwares and technologies (except the development 
                    sector and some server's virtual machines which uses the rock-solid 
                    Debian). I feel more confortable working with free and open source 
                    software (for reasons that I may explain in other posts) and saw it 
                    as an opportunity to show and bring possibilities for actual and 
                    future open source adepts to enjoy the services that have been 
                    deprived of them because of problems in interoperability. Problems 
                    that may have made people there think that they do not like open 
                    source systems because it looks be hard and less functional.

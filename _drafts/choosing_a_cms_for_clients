abstract: "When clients come to me requesting a website for their business, they often don't know how things work. Most of them don't know the difference between building a website and using an online blogging platform. When content publishing appears in the project's requisites, a CMS (Content Management System) enters the game. Usually there's no need to build a CMS from scratch, so I decided to explore some from the wide range of CMS applications available on the Web."

abstract: "Lexicanalytics will hava an upgrade of features regarding statistical measurement and multiple text productions support for a broader report functionality. It will bring the application's analytics nature a step further. Lexicanalytics will provides more use for researchers with graphs, save reports and so on. Technically, I'm planning to use R language within Java using JRI."

Back to the days when I was learning the first steps on programming, around 2008, there was already a well based community developing web applications, so I'm not from the ages where programming was defined by text-based applications, hard GUI and on. Although my first contact with a terminal, writing commands, showing powerful results, motivated me to learn more and more about desktop programming. While the world was adopting the web as the developing platform, I felt it very unstable comparated to the desktop. Maybe that was an illusion of my young mind, but even so things changed, Web is a really powerful place today, we have [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), and, particularly, [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).


Last year I decided to leave my pride and start to seriously learn javascript (until that it was just a bunch of few useful commands to me) and what I saw was a terrific language. Combined with CSS3 and HTML5, we get the power to build a web page which have the performance of a desktop application, running on the client side, and offer cutting edge dynamism through the web. A language that runs fast and gives me stability were some of my first glimpses, my surprise was the freedom I felt about designing my frontend and how independent it can be to the backend. That last fact helped me to modularize my own work, bring a kind of not-forced harmony to my projects. Still, develop a beautiful page was a weak spot.

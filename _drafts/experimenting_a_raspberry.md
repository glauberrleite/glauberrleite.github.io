This week I got a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B primarly for a Software Engineering class project, that is the one which I'll be working for the time. I'm planning to build a simple wheater station using some sensors, and upload that data to a server that will process that data to show reports. Aside, I have been designing a portable web radio streaming solution for the university where I work, using a Raspberry Pi 2 with Raspbian, Darkice and Darksnow to configure and upload a audio stream from an event that will occur September 19.


For the wheater station, I currently ordered pluviomenter, humidity and temperature sensors, but I am thinking to buy a barometer and build a wind velocity sensor (as a proper anemometer is quite expensive for my current budget). Still in the Raspberry Pi, the OS will be the Raspbian, as it have wide support in that field and is based on a GNU/Linux distro that I love, Debian. Furthermore, I'll develop a Python program for control that will upload the data to the server. For the server side I'm planning to create a web app, although I don't know if I'll be using AngularJS, Django, Rails or PHP.

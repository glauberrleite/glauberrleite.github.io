As said in the About section of this site, I'm studying Computer Engineering. Many people say that _one_ of the course's goal is to provide to an individual the possibility of understand how a computer works and even build one kind of that. (see the course program). (see if people have done this yet).


So I decided to start a journey to build my own computer (too?). I will work on it as I'm evolving my studies through the course and sharing the experience for those who may have interest in this sort of thing (maybe building your kind of computer too). As I'm really willing to build some boards, the depth of the system building will be relative to the depth of details my course program give me, and I will try to expand it a little more. Thus, I'm planning to start the building with some Hardware Description Language ([Verilog](http://www.verilog.com/) or [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL)) to make an [ALU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit) and so on.


I know that a working computer is a concept that may vary from person to person, because of that I'll list what kind of system that I expect to achieve at the end of this project:

 * Capable of doing numerical calculations;
 * Compile C code, or even C++;
 * I'll try to put Hurd kernel (that I'm willing to help develop) or Linux on it;
 * Make it possible to run GNU/Linux programs;
 * Completely free/open source softwares;
 * All documentation licensed with free usage license.


P.S.: It's important to know that, because it will run through my course, this project will demand a long, long time to be over.
